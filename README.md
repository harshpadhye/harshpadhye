# Harsh Padhye (he/him/his)

Hi! My name is Harsh and I am a graduate from the University of Virginia with Bachelor's of Arts degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science. Most of my schoolwork is hidden in private repos (in compliance with UVA's Honor Policy) but I would be happy to share them with you through a personal channel. Feel free to [email me](mailto:harshpadhye@gmail.com) with any questions or concerns. Thank you for visiting my page! :musical_note:
