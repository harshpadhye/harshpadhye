# Harsh Padhye (he/him/his)

Hi! My name is Harsh and I am a second-year Computer Science and Mathematics double major at the University of Virginia. I have programming experience in Java, Python, C++, Processing, SQL, and Bash. In my free time, I like to cook, garden, and play the guitar and piano.  

Most of my schoolwork is hidden in private repos (in compliance with UVA's Honor Policy) but I would be happy to share them with you through a personal channel. Feel free to [email me](mailto:harshpadhye@gmail.com) with any questions or concerns. Thank you for visiting my page! :musical_note:
